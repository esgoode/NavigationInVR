*Interface

The interface was constructed so users could easily switch between our various movement methods. These movement methods are listed below with their description. When the user puts on the headset, the user can see the terrain around them. We have built these methods, so the user can use them in a variety of terrains. However, we built our own default terrain for building and development purposes. With the headset on, the user can also see in red the name of the movement method they are on, a description, and instructions on how to use. To switch movement methods, the user can cycle through the different kind of methods with the a and b buttons on the right rift hand controller.



*Purpose
The purpose of our project was to create and evaluate different movement methods. Virtual reality is a wonderful tool, but for large environments, movement is limited. The main reasons being that users often work in a  confined space, movement in large environments can be exhausting, and certain speed movement features can cause nausea and other symptoms. Our aim in this project was to develop methods that already existed or were novel to this project and evaluate them on a number of metrics. These metrics include speed, induced nausea, and others. We are currently in the evaluation process and will have the evaluation documentation complete Tuesday December 12th.

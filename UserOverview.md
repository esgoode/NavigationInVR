# Interface

The interface was constructed so users could easily switch between our various movement methods. These movement methods are listed below with their description. When the user puts on the headset, the user can see the terrain around them. We have built these methods, so the user can use them in a variety of terrains. However, we built our own default terrain for building and development purposes. With the headset on, the user can also see in red the name of the movement method they are on, a description, and instructions on how to use. To switch movement methods, the user can cycle through the different kind of methods with the a and b buttons on the right rift hand controller.

* Teleporter: Press Left Index Trigger And Point The Controller At Your Target. Release Trigger To Teleport
* Controller: Use The Left Control Stick To Move Around The Environment
* Hoverboard: Press and Hold The Left Trigger Then Tilt The Controller To Move Around
* Grapple: Point The Left Controller At Your Target Location. Press And Hold The Trigger To Move To It
* Platform: Use The Left Control Stick To Move The Platform
* Swinging Arm: Hold The Left Index Trigger To Begin Walking. Swing Your Arms To Move Forward
* Pinch to Zoom: Press hand trigger to set max arms-lenght. Press and hold index trigger while spreading arms to move forward
* Jet Pack: Hold the Left Index Trigger and tilt the left controller down to lift off. Look in the direction you want to move and let go of the trigger to fall
* Ski: Hold the left and right Hand Triggers to pull yourself through the environment. You can use one or both controllers.
* Earth Soar: Press Left Trigger to Teleport Up High. Use Left Thumbstick to Move through the Environment


# Purpose

The purpose of our project was to create and evaluate different movement methods. Virtual reality is a wonderful tool, but for large environments, movement is limited. The main reasons being that users often work in a  confined space, movement in large environments can be exhausting, and certain speed movement features can cause nausea and other symptoms. Our aim in this project was to develop methods that already existed or were novel to this project and evaluate them on a number of metrics. These metrics include speed, induced nausea, and others. We are currently in the evaluation process and will have the evaluation documentation complete Tuesday December 12th.
